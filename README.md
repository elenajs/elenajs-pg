elenajs-pg
=======

Currently it just enables Brian C's node-postgres to be used with elenajs AMD system.

## Documentation

Currently this module doesn't add anything to the original one, except the
elenajs AMD capability. 
For documentation see [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) homepage.

Adding the [promise pattern] (https://www.promisejs.org/patterns/) as the rest 
of elenajs coding style, will be done in future.
